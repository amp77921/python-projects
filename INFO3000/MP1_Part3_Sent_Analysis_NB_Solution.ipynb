    "In this complete example, we generate a small bunch of synthetic survey responses for a new car called CarX and assign sentiment labels to them. We performed sentiment analysis using the VADER sentiment analyzer and extract sentiment scores. We then create a DataFrame to store the responses, sentiment labels, and sentiment scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we apply CounteVectorizer(BOW) and TFIDF vectorizer to numerically encode the features and checke the result in each case. We split the data into training and testing sets, oversample the train data to remove any imbalance and then fit a random Forest Classifier model on the training set. The trained models are used to predict sentiment labels for the test set in each case.\n",
